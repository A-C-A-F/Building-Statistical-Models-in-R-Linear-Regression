# Building Statistical Models in R: Linear Regression

### Project Objectives
In this project, I am going to focus on three learning objectives:
1.	Build simple and multiple linear regression models 
2.	Perform model assessment and interpretation of results 
3.	Perform diagnostic checks to test for model assumptions 

### Project Structure
- __Task 1:__ Getting Started
- __Task 2:__ Import Packages & the dataset
- __Task 3:__ Explore the dataset
- __Task 4:__ Data Visualization
- __Task 5:__ Model Building
- __Task 6:__ Model Assessment I
- __Task 7:__ Model Assessment II
- __Task 8:__ Model Prediction
- __Task 9:__ Assumptions Check: Diagnostic Plots
- __Task 10:__ Multiple Regression
