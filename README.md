# Building Statistical Models in R Linear Regression

### Project Objectives
In this project, I am going to focus on three learning objectives:
1.	Build simple and multiple linear regression models 
2.	Perform model assessment and interpretation of results 
3.	Perform diagnostic checks to test for model assumptions
